### Overview 
Navida was suppose to be a fullstack video processing service platform but I am too lazy to add any frontend tbh and I suck at it too lmao
so this project end up being my practice project for learning GCP and docker as before this I was not aware of those. 
might take this project up in future and work on it more or might try it with GO laters, lets see.
