Got better things to work on also screw you GCP , ffs why there's no way to push docker image to google cloud without f'n billing bs, my card is VBV which doesn't allow autopay, and billing details don't work cuz of that sadly :< if anyone is reading this and know any way to get rid of the issue pls let me know over Twitter or discord(profile-IDs are provided in my GitHub description), Thanks!!
